# privATM
Yet Another PrivEsc &amp; User Enum Script

We started working on a script, that can be used on real systems, focussing on things that:
- Still work > 2024
- Can be exploited in pure `Powershell` / `C#` code - so your AMSI evaded shell won't suck as hard
- Doesn't take forever to run
- Light-weight script that won't trigger much

CTF scripts like WinPEAS are awesome, but on real systems it can take forever to run - if you can get it to run without triggering 100 alerts.

## WIP - Work In Progress
We just started working on this. Come back in 3 months or later. Sorry.


### TODO list
- Certify
- Potatoes
- Bloodhound compatible data
- Extra Stealth Mode: No `whoami` etc.

(may or may not happen)

```powershell
$ .\privATM.ps1

[+] SeChangeNotifyPrivilege Allows bypassing some security checks, such as traversing directories. Typically low-risk.
[+] SeUndockPrivilege       Allows undocking the machine. Not generally useful for privilege escalation.
[+] SeTimeZonePrivilege     Allows changing the time zone, which is typically considered low-risk for privilege escalation.
[+] SeLockMemoryPrivilege   Allows locking memory, which could potentially be used to interfere with system stability.
[+] SeShutdownPrivilege     Allows shutting down the system, useful for denial-of-service attacks, but not privilege escalation.
[+] SeTimeZonePrivilege     Allows changing the time zone. Not generally useful for privilege escalation.
[+] SeUndockPrivilege       Allows a machine to be undocked. Generally not useful for privilege escalation.


[ðŸ’€] Testing SeChangeNotifyPrivilege...
[+] You can try bypassing traverse checking to access files in restricted folders, where nested file or folder is accessible to user, e.g using Test-Path

## Bloodhound Data Collection
We started working on data collection for Bloodhound ingestion. Because Sharphound is heavily flagged (including the reflective powershell loader), we're trying to incorporate a **light / stealth** enum for similar data - not sure if we can achieve compatibility in the end, but we'll keep working on it, or provide our own frontend.

We consider `privileges` (also 2nd hand, through a group or machine) as rather **well-known** and usually easy path, that Pentesters should quickly recognize (if they can be enumerated that is). So we may resort towards a rather quick print-out in bright-green colour, if it becomes too complicated to implement.

## Vuln Drivers
Loading of vulnerable drivers like `Capcom.sys` (not included, put in same folder) when `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` is present as well as generic check for common vulnerable drivers already installed on the system.

We haven't yet fully tested if we can pull off driver loading, purely with Powershell / c# - it's right now one of many TODO items that may or may not work in the end. The exploitation of already installed drivers should however work anyways.

[ðŸ’€] Looking for presence of vulnerable drivers already installed...
[+] PROCEXP152.sys is present at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
Driver for Process Explorer, potential to allow privilege escalation by exploiting weak IOCTL. Medium severity.
