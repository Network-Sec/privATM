# privATM
Yet Another PrivEsc &amp; User Enum Script

We started working on a script, that can used on real systems, focussing on things that:
- Still work > 2024
- Can be exploited in pure `Powershell` / `C#` code - so your AMSI evaded shell won't suck as hard
- Doesn't take forever

CTF scripts like WinPEAS are awesome, but on real systems it can take forever to run - if you can get it to run without triggering 100 alerts.

## WIP - Work In Progress
We just started working on this. Come back in 3 months or later. Sorry
